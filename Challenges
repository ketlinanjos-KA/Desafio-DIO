I am taking the DIO Excel with AI course, and the first challenge was to build a real estate investment fund (REIT/FII) investment simulator in Excel.
For this reason, I have attached my file so it can be analyzed.

The second challenge was to create an Excel tool that helps organize and consolidate essential information for income tax declaration.

The third challenge was create an Excel dashboard designed to provide a clear, objective, and strategic visualization of the data, facilitating analysis and supporting informed decision-making.
